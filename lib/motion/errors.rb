        Something about your component cannot be serialized into a string. Make sure it doesn't
        have anything exotic in its state (i.e. a proc, a reference to an anonymous class, etc).

        The specific (but probably useless) error from Marshal was: #{cause}

  class NestedComponentInStateError < InvalidComponentStateError

      super(component, <<~MSG) # TODO: Better message (Focus on "How do I fix this?")
        Detected nested component in state.

        Fundamentally, components live in the DOM. The component instance that you have is
        a template for what to render, **NOT** a handle to the actual rendered component
        (To get an intuition for why it works this way, consider what would happen if
        you rendered a component in a broadcast and sent the resulting markup to many clients.
        Which of those clients instances should this handle refer to? What if no one ever
        renders the markup?).

        In theory, it is technically fine to build up these templates over time and store
        them in your state, but that is almost certainly not what you are expecting here.
        Chances are, you have already rendered this template once and now you are want
        this instance to allow you to access that rendered component. This won't work.

        Alternatives:
          * To communicate from parent to child, pass information into the component before rendering.
          * To communicate from child to parent, use global mutable state (your database) or broadcasts.

        Cannot mount a component from another version of the application.

        Expected revision `#{expected_revision}`;
        Got `#{actual_revision}`

        Cannot set #{option} because Motion has already been used.
        This doesn't really make any sense.
        Make sure you are setting these values in an initializer.
