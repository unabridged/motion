Motion allows you to build reactive, real-time frontend UI components in your Rails application using pure Ruby.

* Plays nicely with the Rails monolith you have.
* Peacefully coexists with your existing tech: Strong Parameters, Turbolinks, Trix, React, Vue, etc.
* Real-time frontend UI updates from frontend user interaction AND server-side updates.
* Leans on ActionCable and ViewComponent for the heavy lifting.
* No more frontend models, stores, or syncing; your source of truth is the database you already have.
* No JavaScript required!


## Installation

1. Install Motion gem and JS package

Motion has Ruby and JavaScript parts, execute both of these commands:

```sh
bundle add motion
yarn add @unabridged/motion
```

2. Install ViewComponent

You need a view component library to use Motion. Technically, any view component library that
implements the [`render_in` interface that landed in Rails 6.1](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36388)
should be compatible, but Motion is actively developed and tested against
Github's [ViewComponent](https://github.com/github/view_component).

Installation instructions for [ViewComponent are here](https://github.com/github/view_component#installation).

3. Install ActionCable

Motion communicates over and therefore requires [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html).

4. Run install script

After installing all libraries, run the install script:

```sh
bin/rails g motion:install
```

This will install 2 files, both of which you are free to leave alone.


## How does it work?

Motion allows you to mount special DOM elements (henceforth "Motion components") in your standard Rails views that can be real-time updated from frontend interactions, backend state changes, or a combination of both.

- **Websockets Communication** - Communication with your Rails backend is performed via ActionCable
- **No Full Page Reload** - The current page for a user is updated in place.
- **Fast DOM Diffing** - DOM diffing is performed when replacing existing content with new content.
- **Server Triggered Events** - Server-side events can trigger updates to arbitrarily many components via WebSocket channels.
- **Partial Page Replacement** - Motion does not use full page replacement, but rather replaces only the component on the page with new HTML, DOM diffed for performance.
- **Encapsulated, consistent stateful components** - Components have continuous internal state that persists and updates. This means each time a component changes, new rendered HTML is generated and can replace what was there before.
- **Blazing Fast** - Communication does not have to go through the full Rails router and controller stack. No changes to your routing or controller are required to get the full functionality of Motion.


### Frontend interactions

Frontend interactions can update your Motion components using standard JavaScript events that you're already familiar with: `change`, `blur`, form submission, and more. You can invoke Motion actions manually using JavaScript if you need to.

The primary way to handle user interactions on the frontend is by using `map_motion`:

```ruby
class MyComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  include Motion::Component

  attr_reader :total

  def initialize(total: 0)
    @total = 0
  end

  map_motion :add

  def add
    @total += 1
  end
end
```

To invoke this motion on the frontend, add `data-motion='add'` to your component's template:

```erb
<div>
  <span><%= total %></span>
  <%= button_tag "Increment", data: { motion: "add" } %>
</div>
```

This component can be included on your page the same as always with ViewComponent:

```erb
<%= render MyComponent.new(total: 5) %>
```

Every time the "Increment" button is clicked, MyComponent will call the `add` method, re-render your component and send it back to the frontend to replace the existing DOM. All invocations of mapped motions will cause the component to re-render, and unchanged rendered HTML will not perform any changes.


### Backend interactions

Backend changes can be streamed to your Motion components in 2 steps.

1. Broadcast changes using ActionCable after an event you care about:

```ruby
class Todo < ApplicationModel
  after_commit :broadcast_created, on: :create

  def broadcast_created
    ActionCable.server.broadcast("todos:created", name)
  end
end
```

2. Configure your Motion component to listen to an ActionCable channel:

```ruby
class TopTodosComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  include Motion::Component

  stream_from "todos:created", :handle_created

  def initialize(count: 5)
    @count = count
    @todos = Todo.order(created_at: :desc).limit(count).pluck(:name)
  end

  def handle_created(name)
    @todos = [name, *@todos.first(@count - 1)]
  end
end
```

This will cause any user that has a page open with `TopTodosComponent` mounted on it to re-render that component's portion of the page.

All invocations of `stream_from` connected methods will cause the component to re-render everywhere, and unchanged rendered HTML will not perform any changes.

## Periodic Timers

Motion can automatically invoke a method on your component at regular intervals:

```ruby
class ClockComponent < ViewComponent::Base
  include Motion::Component

  def initialize
    @time = Time.now
  end

  every 1.second, :tick

  def tick
    @time = Time.now
  end
end
```

## Motion::Event and Motion::Element

Methods that are mapped using `map_motion` accept an `event` parameter which is a `Motion::Event`. This object has a `target` attribute which is a `Motion::Element`, the element in the DOM that triggered the motion. Useful state and attributes can be extracted from these objects, including value, selected, checked, form state, data attributes, and more.

```ruby
  map_motion :example

  def example(event)
    event.type # => "change"
    event.name # alias for type

    # Motion::Element instance, the element that received the event.
    event.target

    # Motion::Element instance, the element with the event handler and the `data-motion` attribute
    event.element


    # Element API examples
    element.tag_name # => "input"
    element.value # => "5"
    element.attributes # { class: "col-xs-12", ... }

    # DOM element with aria-label="..."
    element[:aria_label]

    # DOM element with data-extra-info="..."
    element.data[:extra_info]

    # ActionController::Parameters instance with all form params. Also
    # available on Motion::Event objects for convenience.
    element.form_data
  end
```

See the code for full API for [Event](https://github.com/unabridged/motion/blob/main/lib/motion/event.rb) and [Element](https://github.com/unabridged/motion/blob/main/lib/motion/element.rb).

## Callbacks

Motion has callbacks which will let you pass data from a child component back up to the parent. Callbacks are created by calling `bind` with the name of a method on the parent component which will act as a handler. It returns a new callback which can be passed to child components like any other state. To invoke the handler from the callback, use `call`. If the handler accepts an argument, it will receive anything that is passed to `call`.

**parent_component.rb**
```ruby
  # this will be called from the child component
  def do_something(message)
    puts "Colonel Sandurz says: "
    puts message
  end
```

**parent_component.html.erb**
```erb
  <%= render ChildComponent.new(on_click: bind(:do_something)) %>
```

**child_component.rb**
```ruby
  attr_reader :on_click

  map_motion :click

  def initialize(on_click:)
    @on_click = on_click
  end

  def click
    on_click.call("Do something!") # an argument can be passed into `call`
  end
```

**child_component.html.erb**
```erb
  <%= button_tag "You gotta help me, I can't make decisions!", data: { motion: "click" } %>
```

## Limitations

* Due to the way that Motion components are replaced on the page, component HTML templates are limited to a single top-level DOM element. If you have multiple DOM elements in your template at the top level, you must wrap them in a single element. This is a similar limitation that React enforced until `React.Fragment` appeared and is for a very similar reason.


## Roadmap

Broadly speaking, these initiatives are on our roadmap:

- Enhanced documentation and usage examples
- Support more ViewComponent-like libraries
- Support for AnyCable
- Support for server-side state to reduce over-the-wire HTML size
- Support communication via AJAX instead of (or in addition to) websockets
